 * The VM is configured to automatically run this class, and to call the methods corresponding to

 * This class, via its super class, provides the following methods which are called by the main loop:<br>
 * <br>
 *   - startCompetition(), at the appropriate times:<br>
 * <br>
 *   - robotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on<br>
 * <br>
 * init methods -- each of the following methods is called once when the appropriate mode is entered:<br>
 *     - disabledInit()   -- called each and every time disabled is entered from another mode<br>
 *     - autonomousInit() -- called each and every time autonomous is entered from another mode<br>
 *     - teleopInit()     -- called each and every time teleop is entered from another mode<br>
 *     - testInit()       -- called each and every time test is entered from another mode<br>
 * <br>
 * periodic methods -- each of these methods is called on an interval:<br>
